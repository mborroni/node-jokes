# Project 4: Node Jokes

NodeJokes is a **CLI** application written in Javascript uses the modules [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), [`chalk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk), [`prompt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt) and [`fs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs) from NPM

### Usecases

- Given a _keyword_ searches for jokes in the [_dad joke API_](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and saves them into a `jokes.txt` file. 

- Given the keyword `leaderboard` the application returns the most popular joke found in the `jokes.txt` file. If there isn't a most popular one, it returns a random joke obtained from the same file.
